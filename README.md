# metmuseum-vue-n-vite
Main focus in this project is to use Vue and Vite for displaying stuff by fetching data from metmuseum.github.io


Project finished comments:

I've more or less transcribed my previous project (met-api.project) where i
focused on using and API to fetch data and display and manipulate it in different ways.

In this project i've done more or less the same thing but with help using
Vue and vite together. This project helped strengthen my knowledge for how
Vue works and how it can be very efficient at doing tasks that native javascript
might require alot more lines of code to do. Perhaps more importantly and for a
structure-freak like me it seems to be a lot more structured and easier to work
with each 'component' / 'view' separately and not risk edits spilling over in
the wrong places.

Style and UI is completely ignored here as i have only focused on javascript
and vue
